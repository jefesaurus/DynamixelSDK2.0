DynamixelSDK2.0
===============

A version of Dynamixel SDK for Dynamixel Protocol 2.0 (used with XL-320 and Dynamixel Pro)

The main purpose is to make a Dynamixel SDK that works for USB2AX and XL-320 servos on linux, so that
is what this is being tested with.

To try it out, just run "make" and execute whatever comes out.

Currently this is just a search utility that will find Protocol 2.0 devices on common baud rates and with any available ID.

I'll add more of the commands soon, and hopefully I'll get to Sync Read...
